# ECEC 474
ASIC Design I
This course focused exclusively on digital CMOS Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) systems design and automation. The ASIC physical design flow, including logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing and verification will be presented. These back-end physical design flow steps will also be covered through hands-on practice using industrial VLSI CAD tools. Contemporary design practices will be reviewed and presented in experiments.
